"""
This program operates on a list of sequentially numbered locked boxes (from 0 to n-1). 
Each box may contain keys to unlock other boxes. 
A box can be unlocked if a key with the same number as the box is found. 
Any keys that do not correspond to a box are disregarded.

The first box (0) is always unlocked initially. 
The program's goal is to unlock all boxes. 
It returns True if all boxes can be unlocked with the available keys, 
and False if at least one box remains locked.

The active selection is a Python function named `canUnlockAll`. 
This function is designed to determine if all boxes in a given list can be opened. 
Here's a detailed explanation:

The function `canUnlockAll` takes one argument, `boxes`, which is a list of lists. 
Each list within `boxes` represents a box and the keys it contains. For example, `boxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]` would represent four boxes where the first box contains a key for the second box, the second box contains a key for the third box, and the third box contains a key for the fourth box.

The function starts by initializing a list `keys` with a single element, 0. 
This represents the first box, which is always unlocked.

The function then enters a loop over the `keys` list. 
For each `key` in `keys`, it loops over the `new_key` in the box corresponding to that key (`boxes[key]`). 
If `new_key` is not already in `keys` and `new_key` is less than the length of `boxes` (i.e., it's a valid box number), 
it appends `new_key` to `keys`. This process effectively "unlocks" the boxes as it finds keys for them.

Finally, the function checks if the length of `keys` is equal to the length of `boxes`. 
If they are equal, it means all boxes have been unlocked, so the function returns `True`. 
If they are not equal, it means there are still some locked boxes, so the function returns `False`.

The `len` function is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in a container, 
and the `append` method is a list method that adds an item to the end of the list. 
These are used to manage the list of keys and check if all boxes have been unlocked.
