Dynamic programming is a method used to solve problems by breaaking it down in to smal
smaller subproblems
solves each problem and saves the results which reduces on the number of calculations
when to use Dynamic programming
*optimal substructure
combining optimal results of subproblems to chive optimal result of the bigger problem
*2. Overlapping Subproblems:
approaches
1. top-down(memoization)=> start with the final solutions
2. Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation):=> start with smal problems the to final solutions 

*Greedy Algorithisms
Make locally optimal choices at each step with hope of finding
 global optimum solutions.
 decision are made basing on the inforation available t each moment
 without considering the consequences of the desicion in the future
